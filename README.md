# AgriTrent - Indian Agriculture Data & Crop Yield Analysis

## Overview
This project presents a Power BI report on Indian agriculture. It highlights total area, production, and yield for different crops and states over various years.

## Dataset
The Excel dataset includes columns like Year, State, District, Crop, Area (in 100 ha), Production (in 1000 tonnes), and Yield (kg/ha). This data provides a historical view of agriculture across India.

## Power BI Report & Visuals

- **Slicers (Filters)**: Quickly filter by Year, Crop, or State.
- **Scroller**: Show state and total yield.  
- **Key Metrics Cards**: Show total area, production, and yield at a glance.  
- **Drill-down Pie Chart**: Compares contribution of each state in terms of area or production.  
- **Line Chart**: Displays trends over time for production or yield across states or crops.  
- **Bar Chart**: Highlights yield differences (kg/ha) by state or crop.

## Insights & Observations
- **Top Producing States**: Certain states dominate production or area share.  
- **Yield Differences**: Some states have higher yields despite lower area.  
- **Trend Analysis**: Over the years, you can spot growth or fluctuations in crop production.  
- **Crop-Specific Insights**: Filter by a crop to see which regions excel in its cultivation.
